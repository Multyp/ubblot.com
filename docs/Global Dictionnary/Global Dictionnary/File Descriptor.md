  A file descriptor (FD) in computing is an abstract identifier
used by the operating system to represent an open file 
network socket, or other input/output resource. It serves as
a reference to access and manipulate the underlying data
associated with the resource.

  File descriptors are integral to the UNIX-like operating systems' I/O model,
facilitating communication between processes and the underlying system kernel.
Developers interact with file descriptors through system calls and library functions to
perform operations such as reading, writing, and managing I/O streams efficiently
within their software applications.

  Understanding file descriptors is fundamental for implementing low-level
I/O operations and designing robust, scalable systems.
