  Assembly language is a low-level programming language that
closely resembles the machine language instructions of a computer's
central processing unit (CPU). It provides a more human-readable
representation of machine code instructions, making it easier for
programmers to write and understand code at the hardware level.

  Assembly language programs consist of mnemonic instructions
that correspond directly to the CPU's instruction set,
along with symbolic representations of memory addresses and data.
Programmers use assembly language to optimize performance,
access hardware resources directly, and develop software for embedded systems,
device drivers, and other low-level applications.
