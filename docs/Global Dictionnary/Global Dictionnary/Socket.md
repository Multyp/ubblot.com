A socket is a communication endpoint that allows different processes
to communicate with each other over a network.
It enables data transfer between a client and a server application
by establishing a connection and providing a communication channel
for sending and receiving data packets.

Sockets use a combination of IP addresses and port numbers
to identify the source and destination of data,
facilitating the exchange of information between devices on the network.
