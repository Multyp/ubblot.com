Welcome to the blog part of Ubblot !

Here I will share news about the project but it is also possible I'll share
tutorial, wider articles, we'l see how this evolves.

Again, you can see all my work on my [personal website](https://miguel-dasilva.com).
Don't hesitate to contact me through my mail or LinkedIn if you need anything.

So, what's next ?

First, this version of Ubblot is more of an alpha.
There is a lot of work on the design incoming, I also have to continue learning about
docusaurus and update the features.

Also, you'll see there is not much content for now. I create content regularly when I'm
asked question or feel a subject I'm working on should have an entry here. I work on Ubblot
on my free time so please be patient with me.

I also aim to provide small tutorials for begginers, for example how to do a linked list in C,
use a class in Python, etc. I am still searching for my own formula, I don't
want to do the things like everybody, I want to do my own things so I still have to find out
what is my own thing.

Do not hesistate to contact me if you want me to add entries or if you have a question.
Teamwork is the key for success in programming !

Now, I'll go back to work. Have a nice day and good luck on your programming journey !
